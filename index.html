	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>AWAY (Are We Art Yet?) is a coalition of artists working to bridge the forming divide between traditional, digital, and AI creators. Our work centers a multi-modal approach, utilizing new media technologies without sacrificing ethics in its distribution. AWAY firmly believes in accessible artmaking for people of all abilities, and seeks to close the literacy divide between the early adapters and future artists in the medium. <br></br> Could that artist be you?</p>

	<p>Hi! I'm Cad, which could be short for Cadmus (who was transformed into a dragon) or Cadaeic (who names the numbers of pi) or anything you'd like. I'm a transmasc Asian-Australian using image synthesis to illustrate fantasy stories, tabletop games and other flights of fancy, as well as to explore naval art history. I also occasionally tinker with code on the side, finding that AI art appeals to both the creative and the technical sides of my brain. It's been fun, though I primarily generate pictures of sailing ships and resplendently rainbow sailing ships!</p>

	<p>I had gotten into AI art relatively early on, and I have loved watching its rapid progression and I'm sure I'll love seeing what's next. I love mixing concepts, ideas, artists, styles and mediums and seeing what the little robot does with it.</p>
